## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk **1 and 3/4 cups of flour** and **1/2 teaspoon baking soda** together in medium bowl; set aside.

2. Heat **10 tablespoons** butter in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until melted till dark golden brown and has nutty aroma. Remove skillet from heat and transfer browned butter to large heatproof bowl. Stir remaining **4 tablespoons butter**.

3. Add both **1/2 & 3/4 cups of brown and white sugars**, **1 teaspoon salt** and **2 teaspoons vanilla** to bowl with butter and whisk until fully incorporated. Add **egg and yolk** and whisk until mixture is smooth with no sugar lumps remaining, about 30 seconds. Let mixture stand for 3 minutes then whisk for 30 seconds. Repeat process of resting and whisking 2 more times until mixture is thick, smooth and shiny. Using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir in **flour mixture** until just combined, about 1 minute. Stir in **1 and 1/4 cups chocolate chunks** and **3/4 cup of nuts**, giving dough final stir to ensure no flour pockets remain.

4. Divide dough into 16 portions, each about 3 tablespoons. Arrange 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets, 8 dough balls per sheet.

5. Bake cookies **1 tray at a time** until cookies are golden brown and still puffy, and edges have begun to set but centers are still soft, 10-14 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. Transfer baking sheet to wire rack; cool cookies completely before serving.

## Hank's Mom's Notes:

- Use parchment paper.
- Do not double recipe.
- These cookies are meant to be large. They are a bit fussy but work it.
